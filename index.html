          <h3>You want to scrobble all of your music. Even the vinyl.</h3>

<p>The goal of this project is to let you do that. While this has a ways to go before it's great, it already works in many cases.</p>

<p>Here's what you need to run vinyl-fm:</p>

<ul>
    <li>vinyl-fm. Download it above!</li>
    <li>A record player with USB-out plugged into your computer (It might work with mini jack, but I haven't tested it. It probably won't work over-the-air with a microphone yet.)</li>
    <li>A bunch of software requirements. First get <a href="http://portaudio.com/download.html">portaudio</a> (I built this from source; I think there was a problem with the homebrew version).</li>
    <li>Then:<pre><code>pip install pyaudio Cython pyechonest pylast</code></pre></li>
    <li>Finally, you need to get the <a href="http://static.echonest.com/ENMFP_codegen.zip">EchoNest Music Fingerprint codegen binary.</a> This is the library that we use to create create a fingerprint of the incoming audio clip. The EchoNest's servers then try to match this to one of the millions of songs in their database.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ok, now let's scrobble some vinyl!</h3>

<pre><code>python vinylfm.py</code></pre>

<p>You will be asked to enter your username and password. The password is immediately hashed and authorized by last.fm (it's not being saved in plaintext anywhere- don't worry!).</p>

<p>Make sure that you switch your sound input settings to use the record player (however it's attached).</p>

<p>Now start playing records! Hopefully you'll see some indication in the terminal that vinyl-fm has identified and scrobbled your tunes.</p>

<h3>I know, it's rough.</h3>

<p>Please leave feedback! File a bug report! Whatever! I have to know what doesn't work to know what to fix.</p>

<p>Here's my current to-do list:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Interpolate album and songs given some successful matches</li>
    <li>De-dupe matches with similar titles so the same song doesn't get scrobbled several times in a row.</li>
    <li>More intelligent recording (looking for silence to find the beginning of a song?)</li>
</ul>
